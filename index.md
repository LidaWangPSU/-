## Bio

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics from Penn State University, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://dajiangliu.blog/" target="_blank"> Dajiang Liu</a>. My research focus in statistical genetics, functional genomics and data science.

In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/" target="_blank"> Calico</a>, a subsidiary of Alphabet. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics from <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank"> Georgetown University</a> advised by Prof. Ao Yuan and Min Tan and my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from 
<a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en//" target="_blank"> Southern University of Science and Technology</a> advised by Prof. Guoliang Tian.


## Research Interests
- Functional Genomics: Explore the causal relationships between multi-omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenetics) and human diseases.
- Statistical Genetics: Assess the associations between genetic variants and human traits and predict disease risk.
- Data Science: Develop and apply machine learning and deep learning models to analyze large-scale datasets and enhance the accuracy of predictive models.
